Ansible Role: Firewalld
=========
This ansible role installs firewalld and allows for easy firewall 
configuration via variables. 

When managing a lot of ports this role becomes particularly useful due 
to its capability to specify lists of ports and services per zone.


Requirements
------------
For configuration the ansible module [firewalld](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/posix/firewalld_module.html) is used.

Variables
------------
List of firewalls to disable via Ansible's service module:
```
firewalld_disable_firewalls: []
```

A list of port definitions:
```
firewalld_ports: []
```

A list of service definitions:
```
firewalld_services: []
```

Example Playbook
------------
```
